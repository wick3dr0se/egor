## Performance

The results seen here were produced (with this demo) from an optimized release build with a Ryzen 5 2600 and a Radeon Pro WX2100 using the Vulkan backend on Wayland/Arch Linux. Each crab is updated and rendered individually, without GPU instancing

## Spawning Crabs

Click to spawn 9,999 crabs at a time. Repeat to see how many **egor** can handle
